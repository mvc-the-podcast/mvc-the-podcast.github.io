Marty ([@martystepp](http://twitter.com/martystepp)) is a computer science lecturer at Stanford.

Victoria ([@bictolia](http://twitter.com/bictolia)) is a senior software engineer at Google.

Together they form MVC: Marty Victoria Conversations! Every week Marty and Victoria casually chat about technology and stuff in the news. Sometimes ranty. Sometimes ragey. Always with spotty audio quality.
